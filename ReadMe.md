# About
Our project consists of creating a web application that allows students to access on demand tutoring. Tutors could decide when and where they are available to work and students could choose what tutor to receive help from. Many current tutoring or office hours occur during the day when both students and student tutors are attending class, meetings, and/or work. Additionally, they are expected to work on assignments and attend tutoring sessions in between these responsibilities. With our web applications, both students and tutors have the opportunity to give or receive tutoring with more flexibility. Lastly, our application would allow for quick questions to be asked and answered through in app chat.

The application would first prompt the user to log in or sign up and create an account. When creating an account, the user would specify if they are a student or tutor and the classes they wish to receive/give help on. Once an account has been made and the profile updated, students would be able to search for available tutors for specific classes and tutors would be able to mark themselves as available to tutor. Students and tutors would also be able to send and receive messages through the chat. To accomplish the application, a list of tasks are described. Tasks include downloading and setting up the environment we will be using and implementing the sign in page, maps page, profile page, chat messaging, and chat log page. Additional tasks include implementation of four APIs which include the Autho API, Google Maps API, Weavy API & SDK, Google Geo.Apify, and OpenWeatherMap API.

Certain tasks like the in house chatting are focused on the different personas that our application is geared towards. The in house chat focuses on people with hearing by providing a visual way of communicating. The option for tutors to be available or not benefits student tutors who wish to truly focus on academics first. The option to search for available tutors at any given time provides students in need of help after hours to receive tutoring. Lastly, the more flexible hours would decrease the number of students per tutor, giving students who struggle with anxiety a more comfortable environment. These tasks are planned and scheduled through the use of a product backlog, burndown chart, and sprint backlog.
